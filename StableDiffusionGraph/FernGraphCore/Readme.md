## About BlueGraph

FernGraphCore actually comes from [BlueGraph](https://github.com/McManning/BlueGraph), the Github link of the source project is: [McManning/BlueGraph: Visual Scripting Framework for Unity (github.com)](https://github.com/McManning/BlueGraph)

I made some modifications based on BlueGraph, but I canâ€™t remember exactly what I changed, and there may be more modifications in the future, but I will continue to keep this statement, thanks to the contributions of BlueGraph developers!
